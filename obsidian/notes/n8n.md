The idea of using n8n within this kubernetes project is to produce proposals of stratergies for imperative fixes of bad states.
Essentially, i want n8n or some other tool to show me (alteranativly implement) automatic solutions so that bad
states can be reconciliated without AI. Basically, we only use AI to map deterministic solutions to bad staes.
