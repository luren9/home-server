Add all linux/OS changes to ansible playbook. Should be tested when cluster is expanded to server pc (when we are adding new nodes). All theese linux changes are found scattered across in markdown files. Plus we need the basic
kubernetes `swapoff` commands to run to be part of that playbook, i think. It should be easily scalable and as simple as running a single script to setup the entire PC with the cluster given that it is connected to the same internet. Also, the playboook should mayhaps leave some confroom for things like, should it have a pvc provisioner? and so on. How many pods? And yada yada all those thinklable confs.
