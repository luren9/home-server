This would be really cool to fix, probably doable with some extension.

I would like to be able to create links as we can with notes with code fils instead where clicking brings it up in Vs-code and its grayed out if it doesn't exist. It being grayed out would prompt a future maintainer to look for the actual file-path and fix the documentation.
